# niaga_hosting frontend test

## Project runs on npm
### Couple of notes
```
I did not manage to use Laravel, but I have finished the rest of the task as requested.
```
```
Some of the SVG images are broken and not-usable (composer.svg, zendguard,ioncube), which resorts me to use png instead. 
```
```
I have made the price according to a JSON file in /src/data.json that contains name, id, price, discount price, number of pengguna and best
```
```
The fonts are hard to differentiate, and the website no longer resembles the mockup. I tried my best on making it as similar as possible
```

```
IMPORTANT NOTE: The price section is also adaptive, it depends on which has best=true based on data.json.
```
## External Add-ons
```
Bootstrap
```
```
Font Awesome
```
